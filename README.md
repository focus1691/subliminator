<h1 align="center">Subliminator</h1>
<p align="center">A desktop program to show subliminal messages onto your computer screen in the background. They will draw on top of your current windows. You can modify the interval and duration of these messages. They can be shown as fast as quick as 50ms for a subliminal effect.</p>
<p align="center">The GUI is built with Java Swing. The method used to build the functionality was `JFrame` pooling and it uses multithreading to handle the scheduling and displaying of multiple messages at once.</p>

<h2 align="center">Issues</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The JFrame is not invisible so it can block areas that it appears on top of on your computer. It is like a window appearing on top of something you try to click on.</li>
  <li>Need a way to multiselect messages besides the "select all". A fast select scroll would be really useful.</li>
</ol>
